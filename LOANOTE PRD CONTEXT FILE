## 1. Overview

The Finance Tracker App is a mobile application designed to help users manage personal finances by tracking contacts, transactions, and overall balances. The current implementation is a strong starting point, and this document outlines improvements and enhancements to elevate its usability, scalability, and international appeal over the long term.

## 2. Problem Statement

Users need a reliable, user-friendly tool to track monetary transactions associated with contacts. The app must provide accurate financial summaries, detailed transaction histories, and support input validation. However, the current version lacks multi-language support, persistent data storage, advanced currency handling, and additional UI enhancements.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- **Enhance Localization:** Provide multi-language support (e.g., English, Turkish, Spanish, French, etc.) with locale-specific formatting.
- **Improve Currency Management:** Allow users to choose and convert between multiple currencies and format numbers accordingly.
- **Ensure Data Persistence:** Integrate local storage or a database solution to maintain data across sessions and support backup/sync functionality.
- **Elevate User Experience:** Modularize components, refine input validation, and add animations and theming (including dark mode).
- **Expand Financial Reporting:** Introduce advanced sorting, filtering, and detailed transaction reporting.

---

## 4. Target Audience

- **Primary Users:** Individuals looking to manage personal finances and track transactions with their contacts.
- **Secondary Users:** Users dealing with multiple currencies or international transactions who require localized formatting and language support.

## 5. Key Features

### 5.1 Localization & Internationalization
- **Multi-Language Support:**  
  - Integrate libraries like react-i18next or react-native-localize.
  - Allow selection among 3–5 languages (e.g., English, Turkish, Spanish, French, etc.).
- **Locale-Specific Formatting:**  
  - Dynamically adjust currency symbols and number formatting based on user settings.

### 5.2 Currency and Financial Enhancements
- **Currency Conversion:**

  - Enable tracking of transactions in different currencies.
  - Provide settings to choose the default currency.
- **Advanced Financial Reporting:**  
  - Categorize transactions (e.g., bills, groceries, entertainment).
  - Visualize data through graphs or charts.

### 5.3 Data Persistence and Storage
- **Local Storage / Database Integration:**  
  - Use AsyncStorage, SQLite, or Realm to persist data between sessions.
- **Backup & Sync:**  
  - Integrate cloud backup (e.g., Firebase) to allow users to restore or sync their data across devices.

### 5.4 User Interface & Experience Improvements

  - Break the app into smaller, reusable components (e.g., ContactCard, TransactionHistory, AddContactForm).
- **Enhanced Input Validation:**  
  - **Name Field:** Accept only valid text characters (letters and spaces).
  - **Phone Field:** Validate against international phone formats (using a library like libphonenumber-js).
  - **Amount Field:** Ensure it accepts only positive real numbers.
- **UI Feedback & Animations:**  
  - Add animations for card expansion/collapse.
  - Implement theming options (including dark mode).
- **Error Handling & Logging:**  
  - Integrate robust error handling and consider using error logging tools for production issues.

### 5.5 Additional Features for Enhanced Usability

   - Support for cloud backup and synchronization must be considered for future iterations.

4. **Input Validation:**
   - The **Name** field should only accept valid letters and spaces.
   - The **Phone** field should enforce numeric-only input (with an optional leading “+”).
   - The **Amount** field should accept only positive real numbers, with validations ensuring proper formatting.
